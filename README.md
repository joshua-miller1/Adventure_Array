# Adventure_Array
This project is from my first programming course in Java. 
It uses an array to dynamically create a map, which a user is then able to navigate through in a text based game. 
Players achieve score by seeing the obstacles and escaping the map by finding the helicopter. 

There are three obstacles in the map which they player can either see (the lake or the cliff) and the helicopter which completes the game. 
Players naviagte using the w,s,a,d keys in an array. The map is a hidden feature which can be discovered by reading the credits.
At any time the player can enter the letter 'm' to print the map (the array) of the game. 

This project was able to uses arrays, loops, user input, and try-and-catch validation. The validation was used to catch out of bound errors, and 
to prevent obstacles from overlapping each other in the creation of the map.
